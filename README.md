# ParkingMeter
Simulate a virtual parking meter with Python/Tkinter. Initally created to educate myself with SQlite3, I've turned it into a program that would allow users to book times in different parking lots across town and calculate the amount owed at the end. Each user's data is submitted to the database and pulled upon initilization.
